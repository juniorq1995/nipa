Hello, this branch contains work that analyzes precipitation data collected from hundreds of weather stations over the last
century. Once this data is collected it can be fed into another program that translates the data into a  distribution map 
that shows areas of the country with significant changes in their precipiation levels for certain seasons.

This branch is shared with my research advisor who created some of these programs. 
I would like to draw your attention to the following files that I created:
dw.py
fList.py
nipa_gui.py
sList.py
sm_gui.py
station_module.py
utilityF.py
wc.py
wc_gui2.py
wc_gui3.py
